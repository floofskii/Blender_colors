# Blender_colors

This script automates the import, processing, and rendering of 3D models (.obj, .stl, .glb) in Blender. It adjusts mesh orientation, scales models to fit within a bounding box, and generates both static images and 360-degree turntable animations from dynamic camera angles. The output includes high-resolution PNGs and MP4 videos for easy visualization.
